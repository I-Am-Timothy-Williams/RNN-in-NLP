#What makes Doc2Vec so powerful

# Averaging numbers is a naive way to capture information about a group of numbers
# Averaging numbers causes you to lose information because youre taking x numbers 
# and trying to represent them with 1 number
# Doc 2 Vec captures information about a sentence or paragraph, in a much more sophisticated way than 
# Word 2 Vec
