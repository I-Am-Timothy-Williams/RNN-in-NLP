#What is a Recurrent Neural Network
# Pattern Matching through the connection of many very simple functions to create
# One very powerful function; this function has an understanding of the data's sequential nature as it uses feedback loops
# That form a sense of memory
# To envision this, part of the output of the initial word is used with the input of the next word that the model sees.
