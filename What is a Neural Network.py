#What is a Neural Network
#Pattern Matching through the connection of Many Very Simple Functions
#To Create One Very Powerful Function, Very Loosely Based On Connected Neurons in The Brain


# You have an Input, a Hidden Layer, an Output
# Shallow Neural Network - Only one Hidden Layer
# Fully Connected Network - Each node is connected to every node on both sides of it
# Feedforward Network - Information Flows Directly from the input to hidden to output layer without moving backward


#What is Deep Learning?
#Deep Neural Networks Contain several hidden layers (where the computation is done)
